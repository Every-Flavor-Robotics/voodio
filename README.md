Voodoo magic for iot devices!  Ie. Android apps that control esp32 and arduino projects

# This is a research project and my first time using flutter, so its going to be a long journey

I would like the first MVP to be an android app that has a single button and a bluetooth integration running with an esp32 to respond to that button press.

Currently, the plan is to use Flutter for development.
